    <p> This is a small bio about me so that people can get to know who I am and understand me more,
        I am current in college trying to get my bacholer's degree in animation and motion graphics. 
        My intreast is anime, manga, and comics, what I like to do for fun is swimming, art and listening
        to music.I did not have alot of confidence in my art to say that I was good enough to be a animator
        so i'm trying to get as much help as I can to improve and get better at it. I want to display 
        my art so that I can get feedback and see what areas I could improve and get constructive criticism 
        form professional animators and artist. </p>
   
    <p> I first started drawing seriously in elementry school after the death of my grandmother I started to get serious with my art and planned to go to art school to a school for the arts. The death of my grandmother had a huge affect on my art I was so depressed after she died it was not a happy time in my life and I need to refocus on something other than grief.  </p>
